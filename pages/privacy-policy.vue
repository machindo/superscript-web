    </p>

    <p>
      This customer Privacy Policy of Justin Paul Silva D/B/A Superscript (“Company”) covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by the Company anytime you interact with the Company, such as when you visit our website, when you purchase the Company’s products and services online, when you download our software or app, or when you call our customer service associates. Please take a moment to carefully read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is a priority at the Company, and we go to great lengths to protect it.

    </p>

    <h2>1. Reasons the Company Collects Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer service and further refine our software and apps. It enables us to give you convenient access to our software, apps, products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you. In addition, your personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest Company announcements and events that you might like to hear about.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information the Company Collects and How the Information May be Used</h2>
    <p>
      We collect information from and about users of our website or app:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Directly from you when you provide it to us.
      </li>
      <li>
        Automatically when you use the website or app (please refer to Sections 3 and 4, below, for further information about automatic data collection and your options for opting out).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you better products. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not collect credit card or bank information directly, as that service is handled by our third-party, online payment provider, Stripe, Inc.

      The information that we collect includes:
    </p>
    <ul>

        Your responses to surveys that we might periodically ask you to complete for research purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your computer name when activating a license on your computer, in order for you to distinguish between computers when managing your licenses.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information, to: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provide you with the app and its contents, and any other information, products or services that you request from us.
      </li>

      <li>
        Give you notices about your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection.
      </li>
      <li>
        Notify you when app updates are available, and of changes to any products or services we offer or provide though it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Automatic Information Collection and Tracking</h2>
    <h3>
      What do we collect automatically?
    </h3>
    <p>
      We, or our third-party service providers on our behalf, gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to understand which parts of our website and services are of most interest to users, to administer the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you access and use the app, we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the app, including traffic data, location of data, logs and the resources that you access and use on or through the app.  The app may access metadata and other information associated with other files stored on your device, and/or may collect real-time information about the location of your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usage information we collect helps us to improve our app and to deliver a better and more personalized experience by enabling us to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Estimate our audience size and usage patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our app according to your individual interests.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recognize you when you use the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recognize you when providing requested support.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You agree that we may collect information about your computer, mobile device, and internet connection, including the device’s unique device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information and the device’s telephone number.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not want us to collect this information, do not download or install the software or the app, or if you have already done so, delete it from your device; you may also opt out at any time by clicking “Analytics and Privacy” in the app's Help menu and deselecting “Share analytics”. For more information about your options, see Section 4, below. Note, however, that opting out of the software or app’s collection of location information will cause its location-based features to be disabled.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How do we collect information automatically?
    </h3>
    <p>
      As is standard practice on many business websites, our website uses “cookies” and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. And we also use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      To opt out of all cookies, we encourage you to look up the instructions provided by your web browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some of our email messages we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on our website, and track this data to help us determine interest in particular topics as well as the usefulness of the information provided. If you prefer not to be tracked, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, we use pixel tags—tiny graphic images—to tell us what parts of our website customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we’re sending only messages that are of interest to our customers. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a customer. We use Google Analytics, which stores this anonymized data on their own servers.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Your Choices About Our Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We collect only the minimum amount of information needed to service your account and we strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. This section describes mechanisms we provide for you to control certain uses and disclosures of your information.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Length that Your Records are Retained.</strong> Your personal information is retained for only as long as is necessary for us to provide you with, and for you to use and enjoy, our software, applications, and services.  You can withdraw your consent at any time.  If you want us to erase your personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@superscript.app">support@superscript.app</a> and we will readily fulfill your request.  Please be aware that in deleting your personal information, we may need to delete your user account. We may contest your request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tracking Technologies.</strong> You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. You can choose whether or not to allow the website and app to collect information through other tracking technologies by changing your <button class="text-button" @click="toggleCookieSettings">cookie settings</button>. If you disable or refuse cookies or block the use of other tracking technologies, some parts of our software or app may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Location Information.</strong> You can choose whether or not to allow the software or app to collect and use real-time information about your device’s location through the device’s privacy settings. If you block the use of location information some parts of the software or app may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. You can opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) on the NAI’s website.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      You always have the right to access and correct the personal information you have provided and can help us ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date. You can review and change your personal information by logging into the website or app and visiting your account profile page. In addition, you can request a copy of your personal information, your product registration history, and your interactions with our staff by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@superscript.app">support@superscript.app</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Our Privacy Policy </h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will post the new Privacy Policy on this page with a notice that the policy has been updated and will notify you by email and/or text message. Your continued use of our website and/or app after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The date the Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address and/or phone number for you and for periodically visiting this privacy policy to check for any changes.
    </p>


    <h2>7. Your Online Company ID and Related Information</h2>
    <p>
      Our website allows you to create an “Superscript ID” based on your personal information. This convenient service saves you time and allows for easier use of our web services and app. In order to create your Superscript ID you will need to create a personal profile by providing your name, phone number, email address, and in some cases your mailing address or a credit card number to our third-party vendor, Stripe, Inc. The system saves the information in your personal profile and assigns you your own unique personal Superscript ID which you can use when performing various activities relating to our website and the apps and services you purchase from the Company.
    </p>

    <h2>8. When the Company Discloses Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      The Company takes your privacy very seriously. The Company does not sell or rent your contact information to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may disclose aggregated information about our users and information that does not identify any individual or device; if you object, please follow the options set forth in Section 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, we may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        With your consent and to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.
      </li>
      <li>
        To contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
      </li>
      <li>
        To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of Superscript’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Superscript about our app users is among the assets transferred.
      </li>
      <li>
        For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Superscript, our customers, or others. This includes providing information as required by law for the purposes of fraud protection or to satisfy laws such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Child Online Privacy Act.
      </li>
      <li>
        To identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our contracts, policies, and procedures and for billing and collections.
      </li>
      <li>
        To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request, including national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. How the Company Protects Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      The Company takes precautions—including administrative, technical, and physical measures—to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our website and applications use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all pages of the website. All user recorded communications with our Company are encrypted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any payment transactions will be handled via Stripe, Inc. and will be encrypted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our website or app, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network, app and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining your personal information. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Privacy of Children</h2>
    <p>
      Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us. The Company recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often purchase our products for family use, including use by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@superscript.app">support@superscript.app</a>. It is our policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws. Therefore, we restrict our website to persons 18 years or older.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      When you use our website, the app, or its content, certain third parties may use automatic information collection technologies to collect information about you or your device. These third parties may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>

    <p>
      These third parties may use tracking technologies to collect information about our users. This may include information about users’ use of our website or app, and perhaps other websites and apps, to provide them with interest-based (behavioral) advertising. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about an advertisement, you should contact the responsible advertiser or company directly.
    </p>
